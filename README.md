# thebezelproject-scripts
Scripts to create shader presets for the HSM Reflection Shader using thebezelproject graphics

## Instructions

This project makes use of some 3rd party utilities.
* “Convert.exe” from [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php)
* “sfk.exe” [(Swiss File Knife)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/swissfileknife/)
and
* “gsar.exe” [(general search and replace utility)](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gsar.htm)
There is quite a bit of setup required to sue these scripts.
